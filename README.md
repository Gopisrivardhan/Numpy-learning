# 🐍 NumPy Learning Journey 🧮

Welcome! This repository is my personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with **NumPy**, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

## 🎯 About This Project

The goal here is to document my progress with NumPy. This includes everything from basic array creation and indexing to more advanced topics like broadcasting, linear algebra, and data loading.

## 📂 What's Inside?

* **`NumPy_learning.ipynb`** 📓: The main Jupyter Notebook! This is where all the code, notes, and practical examples live.
* **`sample.txt`** 📄: A simple text file used for practicing how to load external data into NumPy arrays (using functions like `np.loadtxt`).

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

Want to see the code in action? Here's how:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Gopisrivardhan/Numpy-learning.git](https://github.com/Gopisrivardhan/Numpy-learning.git)
    cd Numpy-learning
    ```

2.  **Install the requirements:**
    (It's always a good idea to use a virtual environment!)
    ```bash
    pip install numpy jupyter
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  **Start exploring!** 💻
    Just click on `NumPy_learning.ipynb` in your browser to open the notebook.
